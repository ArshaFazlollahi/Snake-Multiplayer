# Snake-Multiplayer
⭐A two player combination of Snake Game and Slither.io

🐍The BLUE SNAKE can be controlled using WASD, and the RED SNAKE can be controlled using the arrow keys.

🐍The goal is to eliminate the other player by making them hit your tail after eating apples and growing.

🐍The scoreboard at the top tracks the number of rounds won by each snake color.

🐍After the end of each round you can choose to continue playing, reset the scores by choosing *New Game*, or exit the game completely.

🐍Be careful, if you hit your head on the walls or your own tail the other player wins.

🐍Have fun!
